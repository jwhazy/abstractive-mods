# Abstractive Mods

If you have a Fortnite mod you've created and would like it on the Abstractive marketplace you can create a pull request with the following schema ~~below~~. The first version must be versioned according to the semantic versioning specification, learn more [here](https://semver.org). **Only mods YOU have created are allowed on Abstractive**, if you believe your work has been incorrectly uploaded, please contact me directly via [email](mailto:jacksta@pm.me). While your mod **does not** have to be open-source it will require a full audit by a trusted, direct contributor to Abstractive. If your mod is open-source, you will be able to access the repository directly from within Abstractive.

**The schema is currently being worked on, thank you for your patience.**
